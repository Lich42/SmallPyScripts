# Just some random Python scripts
This is a collection of random python scripts I write that aren't important enough for their own repo.  Most of these are simply me practicing my python skills and probably have no purpose, but that doesn't mean they shouldn't see the light of day!

For information on specific scripts please see the comments at the top of the .py file ;)
