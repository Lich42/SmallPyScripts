motli ("Motivational List") is a small Python script that allows you to create a list of things you've done that you're proud of, along with the current date and time.
The idea of this script is to have a list of things you're proud of, big or small, to look back on for motivation. I realize it doesn't have much a real-world use, but it's fun practice nonetheless ;-)
